I hold a Bachelor's degree in Physics from the Faculty of Exact Sciences and a Bachelor's degree in Surveying Engineering from the National University of Rosario (UNR) in Argentina. For my undergraduate thesis, I performed simulations of internal reactor materials, specifically the moderator tank and cooling channels of the Atucha I Nuclear Power Plant. Currently (2024), I am starting a PhD in Engineering on the same topic. I am also a teaching assistant in the Numerical Methods course for Mechanical and Industrial Engineering degrees.
